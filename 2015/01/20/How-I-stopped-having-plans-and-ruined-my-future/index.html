Out of the home that we built together as a family. The flat that was supposed to be the seed of our future.<br>I was so fucking stupid I can’t even believe it myself. The last year was a complete mess, and I really have nobody else to blame but myself. I don’t really know what I was trying to do. Maybe I was just trying to find myself.<br>What I’ve found is nothing pretty.<br>I had depressions all my life and still have. The first time I attempted suicide, I was 14 years old, sitting with a rope around my neck at my bed, in my parents house. I don’t remember much before that.<br>It was a miracle that I got to 16. Back then, I was lucky to meet the right people which helped keep me alive. I was feeling alone and unloved most of the time, until I met somebody that was just as fucked up as me, and we pulled ourselves out of the dirt.<br>When I was almost 18, I met my future wife. I suddenly had a future. I was afraid that I’d never make it to my 20th birthday. And then it came and went. And I got to 21. I got engaged and married with 22, celebrating my 23rd birthday during our honeymoon.</p><p><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YX19xmgbXVY/VL4dCOxVjAI/AAAAAAAATso/pXWqcUTlNmk/s1600/n%2Bw_hochzeit-027.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Forever</p><p>We were a happy couple. I had a truckload of problems, tucked away in a dark corner of myself that I rarely visited. That really didn’t work so well. I had bursts of anger management problems, suffered from depression and had a very dark outlook for life. I was a pessimist, and it’s totally evident when you look at old pictures that I had very bad times.</p><p><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3yABNvBuGm8/VL4ciXzeQ8I/AAAAAAAATsg/r8vHbEumd8k/s1600/IMG_0409.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Look into my eyes and tell me that I’m happy</p><p>When we lost our first child, I was totally messed up. I started taking antidepressiva and should have gone to therapy back then. I didn’t, because I thought I could make it. After a year or so of taking pills, I grew fed up with myself. My emotions were basically zero, I wasn’t depressed, but I never was happy either. It was impossible to feel anything, bad or good. So I stopped taking them.</p><p>Fast forward a few years. We bought a flat, renovated it and moved in. It was a tense time, lots of work and my wife told me later that I was treating her extremely hostile. I have to admit that I can’t remember being hostile, which makes me sad. I <strong>never ever</strong> wanted her to feel bad.<br>Shortly after, our daughter was born. It was, along with our wedding, the best day in my life.<br>Sure, having kids is anything but easy, but we gave our best and I think we did well.</p><p><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dNC9daN7J4g/VL4d18iwXaI/AAAAAAAATsw/tFoI02ET1JU/s1600/IMG_20111208_090403.jpg" alt=""></p><p>5 days old. I love you.</p><p>Fast forward two years and we had a happy daughter that received more attention and love than anybody else in the universe.<br>But we forgot about ourselves. I don’t know why, but we completely lost our relationship.<br>I think we got too serious and stopped being childish, stupid and funny for each other. We focused our life completely on our daughter.<br>And then I fell in love with another woman. I could not help it. I tried, but I could not change my emotions. So, for the first time ever, I decided to be selfish. That was a <strong>HUGE</strong> mistake, but sadly, it was not the last nor the biggest.<br>It was a rough time, and I was a stupid idiot. I hurt my wife badly and I knew that I was doing it. I was high most of the year, to be able to cope with things. I had lost the love for my wife. But we managed to pull through. There was only a very tiny part left that still resonated inside of me, made me make an effort to save our relationship. We went to a therapist and tried to fix our relationship.<br>He strongly urged me to see a therapist on my own. I wanted to see one at first, but again thought I didn’t have to. That was another huge mistake. You need professional help if you have to battle yourself.</p><p>Our relationship got better, slowly. Or so I thought.</p><p><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-y__5aBGx034/VL4nbE00qII/AAAAAAAATt8/nURqwexh3Ow/s1600/IMG_20150120_103454.jpg" alt=""></p><p>What I did not realize is that I tried to talk myself out of loving my wife. I have absolutely no idea why I did that. <strong>That</strong> was the biggest mistake of my life.</p><p>I did not believe myself. But she did. She never told me that her love was fading because she did not know how. I just learned today that she actually tried. She wrote blog posts that should have rattled me awake, but I did not read them. Not out of ignorance, but because I trusted in technology to notify me when she posted something. That never happened, and I only checked her blog today. Oh, seriously, fuck me. How stupid was I to trust my future on technology?</p><p>My wife fell in love with somebody else. One of my best friends actually. And I helped them in every way that I could.<br>We broke up on 15th of December, 2014. I was devastated and shocked. In an instant I learned how stupid I was, that I still loved her. I had felt my love coming back before that but was afraid to tell her, because I knew how much she hoped for that. I did not want to hurt her and by doing so, I hurt her even more.<br>December was a total mess. We broke up and pulled ourselves together literally every other day.<br>I did things that nobody should ever do, played various mindfuck games and completely wrecked her trust in me. I am disgusted of myself for doing what I did.<br>I pressured her to decide if she wanted a future with me. I knew that I should not do that, but I could not stop myself. I had already lost the battle with me.</p><p>She said no.</p><p>On January 2nd, 2015, I tried to commit suicide. After 12 years, I had finally lost the fight against myself. It wasn’t a knee jerk reaction there was just no conceivable future that I wanted to live in.<br>My family stopped me. Thank you all for that. It was a total reset for me.</p><p>The fighting at home got more intense after that, my emotions went totally overboard. I did even more shit than before. It was unfair that I had to live like this. After all, that’s what I did <strong>not</strong> want to do.<br>But at some point, I started to heal. I want to heal now. I am going to therapy, take antidepressiva again, try to fix my life. It’s not going to be quick, but I will do it.<br>This includes me moving out, causing more pain and stress for my wife, who needs rest. I can’t fix our partnership without fixing myself. I’m just afraid that it’s too late to fix both. She is in love, and I am not the one she loves. This hurts, but I accept it now. It’s my own fault.</p><p>I finally found myself. But at what cost?</p><p><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Bis7NmBv0tk/VL4nTQyUkfI/AAAAAAAATt0/0YsCPCPQ368/s1600/IMG_20150120_110000.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Acrylic and emotions, on canvas.</p><p>Nicole I love you.
